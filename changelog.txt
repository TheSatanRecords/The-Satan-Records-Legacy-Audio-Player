# Version 1.0.0

"The Satan Records Legacy Audio Player" is the "same" - or at least it tries to be - as "The Satan Records Audio Player", except that it uses WPF (a deprecated technology, but still useful) and exists as a STANDALONE .EXE file, meaning that you DON'T have to install anything to use it.
